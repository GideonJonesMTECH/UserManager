Instructions on how to start your application --5 points

All users must be stored in database (MongoDB)

Each of the requirements should make a call to your running NodeJS server. For example, when adding a user, your front end should make a POST request to add the new user. The search functionality should send a GET request with your search term to your NodeJS server to get a list of relevant users.

Styling is completely up to you, but make it clean and readable.

Data should all be stored in Mongodb. The data should persist in the database between start/stop cycles of the server, database, and frontend.
